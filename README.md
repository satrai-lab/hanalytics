# HAnalytics Network Analysis Feature

## Network Analysis Overview

The HAnalytics Network Analysis feature captures and analyzes network traffic to benchmark IoT device performance. This guide provides step-by-step instructions for environment preparation, configuration, execution, and analysis.

![Network Analysis Flowgraph](Hanalytics%20Documentation%2018bb360209608055a87fc780cb789056/image%2014.png)

*Figure 17: Flowgraph of Network Analysis feature of HAnalytics*

The workflow involves:
1. Home Assistant initiates SSH connection to OpenWRT, sending MAC address and runtime parameters.
2. OpenWRT router starts packet capturing.
3. Packet capture files (`.pcap`) are stored temporarily on the router.
4. Files are transferred securely to the analysis server via NFS.
5. Server analyzes packets using `capinfos` and generates structured output.
6. Analysis results are returned to Home Assistant and visualized in the UI.

---

## Step-by-Step Network Analysis Setup

### 1. Environment Preparation

**OpenWRT Router Configuration:**
- Enable SSH access.
- Install packet capturing tools:
```bash
opkg update
opkg install tcpdump timeout
```

**Server Configuration (Ubuntu â‰¥22.04):**
- Install required tools:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install tcpdump wireshark python3 python3-pip nfs-kernel-server
```
- Configure NFS for file sharing:
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /srv/nfs_share1/IBPS
sudo chmod -R 755 /srv/nfs_share1/IBPS
sudo echo '/srv/nfs_share1/IBPS *(rw,sync,no_root_squash)' >> /etc/exports
sudo exportfs -a
sudo systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server
```

**Generate SSH Keys:**
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
ssh-copy-id root@<OpenWRT_IP>
```

---

### 2. Script Configuration

**Place scripts on the server:**
- `/config/openWRT_ssh.sh`
- `/config/openWRT_pcap.sh`
- `/scripts/server_ssh.sh`
- `/scripts/server_pcap.sh`

**Set script permissions:**
```bash
chmod +x /config/openWRT_ssh.sh /config/openWRT_pcap.sh /scripts/server_ssh.sh /scripts/server_pcap.sh
```

**Secure Home Assistant Token:**
Store token securely and dynamically load it:
```bash
HA_TOKEN=$(cat /config/ha_token.txt)
```

**Verify file paths and URLs:**
- Confirm paths (`/config/.ssh/id_rsa_OpenWRT_v2`, `/srv/nfs_share1/IBPS`).
- Update Home Assistant URLs in scripts.

---

### 3. Packet Capturing

**Initiate Capture from the Server:**
```bash
/config/openWRT_ssh.sh <MAC_ADDRESS> <DURATION>
```
- Replace `<MAC_ADDRESS>` with the device MAC.
- Replace `<DURATION>` with capture duration in seconds.

Captured files saved on router at `/root/captures/IBPS` and transferred to server via NFS.

---

### 4. Packet Capture Analysis

Run the server-side analysis script:
```bash
/scripts/server_ssh.sh <MAC_ADDRESS>
```
- Analyzes `.pcap` file and outputs structured data.
- Converts data to JSON format using `parser_JSON.py`.

---

### 5. Sending Analysis Results to Home Assistant

Execute script to send data to Home Assistant:
```bash
/scripts/server_pcap.sh <MAC_ADDRESS>
```
- Ensure Home Assistant sensors (`sensor.packet_capture_analysis`) are active.

---

### Included Scripts

- **openWRT_ssh.sh:** Initiates packet capture remotely on OpenWRT.
- **openWRT_pcap.sh:** Executes `tcpdump` to capture packets on OpenWRT.
- **server_ssh.sh:** Analyzes captured packets using `capinfos`.
- **server_pcap.sh:** Uploads analysis results to Home Assistant.
- **parser_JSON.py:** Parses captured data into JSON for Home Assistant integration.

Ensure scripts and environment configurations align precisely with your setup for the network analysis to work (addresses of the components and file paths e.g YOUR_HA_URL). If the scripts are not properly placed, the buttons of the Hanalytics UI described in the following section might not function properly.
